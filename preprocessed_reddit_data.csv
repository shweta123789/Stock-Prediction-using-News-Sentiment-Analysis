amazon sued by dc attorney general for allegedly excluding neighborhoods from prime delivery,66,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h6gi97/amazon_sued_by_dc_attorney_general_for_allegedly/,1733320404.0,"washington dcs attorney general sued amazon on wednesday accusing the company of covertly depriving residents in certain zip codes in the nations capital from access to primes highspeed delivery

the lawsuit from ag brian schwalb alleges that since  amazon has secretly excluded two historically underserved dc zip codes from its expedited delivery service while charging prime members living there the full subscription price amazons prime membership program costs  a year and includes perks like twoday shipping and access to streaming content

amazon is charging tens of thousands of hardworking ward  and  residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide schwalb said in a statement while amazon has every right to make operational changes it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another

in june  amazon allegedly stopped using its own delivery trucks to shuttle packages in the zip codes  and  based on concerns over driver safety the suit states in place of its inhouse delivery network the company relied on outside carriers like ups and the us postal service to make deliveries according to the complaint which was filed in dc superior court

the decision caused residents in those zip codes to experience significantly longer delivery times than their neighbors in other district zip codes despite paying the exact same membership price for prime the lawsuit says

data from the ag shows that before amazon instituted the change more than  of prime packages in the two zip codes were delivered within two days of checkout that number dropped to as low as  following the move while twoday delivery rates across the district increased to 

amazon has faced prior complaints of disparities in its prime program in  the company said it would expand access to sameday delivery in cities including atlanta chicago dallas and washington after a bloomberg investigation found black residents were about half as likely to be eligible for sameday delivery as white residents

the zip codes in schwalbs complaint are in areas with large black populations according to  census data based on its american community survey

the federal trade commission also sued amazon in june  accusing the company of tricking consumers into signing up for prime and sabotaging their attempts to cancel by employing socalled dark patterns or deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward a specific choice amazon said the complaint was false on the facts and the law the case is set to go to trial in june 

according to scwalbs complaint amazon never communicated the delivery exclusion to prime members in the area when consumers in the affected zip codes complained to amazon about slower delivery speeds the company said it was due to circumstances outside its control the suit says

the lawsuit accuses amazon of violating the districts consumer protection laws it also asks the court to put an end to amazons deceptive conduct as well as for damages and penalties

to get packages to customers doorsteps amazon uses a combination of its own contracted delivery companies usually distinguishable by amazonbranded cargo vans as well as carriers like usps ups and fedex and a network of gig workers who make deliveries from their own vehicles as part of its flex program

amazon has rapidly expanded its inhouse logistics army in recent years as it looks to speed up deliveries from two days to one day or even a few hours in july the company said it recorded its fastest prime delivery speeds ever in the first half of the year delivering more than  billion items within a day

in relying on its own workforce amazon has assumed greater control over its delivery operations

in his complaint schwalb cites an internal company policy that says amazon may choose to exclude certain areas from being served by its inhouse delivery network if a driver experiences violence intimidation or harassment the company relies on ups or usps to deliver packages in excluded areas

gm expects more than  billion impact from china restructuring including plant closures,16,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h6ftzy/gm_expects_more_than_5_billion_impact_from_china/,1733318480.0,"general motors expects a restructuring of its joint venture operations with saic motor corp in china to cost more than  billion in noncash charges and writedowns the detroit automaker disclosed in a federal filing wednesday morning

gm said it expects to write down the value of its jointventure operations in china by between  billion and  billion it also anticipates another  billion in charges to restructure the business including plant closures and portfolio optimization according to the filing

gm which previously announced plans to restructure the operations in china did not disclose any additional details about the expected closures

as we have consistently said we are focused on capital efficiency and cost discipline and have been working with sgm to turn around the business in china in order to be sustainable and profitable in the market we are close to finalizing our restructuring plan with our partner and we expect our results in china in  to show yearoveryear improvement gm said in an emailed statement

gm said it believes the joint venture has the ability to restructure without new cash investments from the american automaker

a majority of the restructuring costs is expected to be recognized as noncash special item charges during the fourth quarter that means they will impact the automakers net income but not its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes  a key metric monitored by wall street

gms operations in china have shifted from a profit engine to liability in the past decade as competition grows from governmentbacked domestic automakers fueled by nationalism and as a generational shift in consumer perceptions of the automotive industry and electric vehicles takes hold

equity income from gms chinese operations and joint ventures peaked at more than  billion in  and 

gms market share in china including its joint ventures has plummeted from roughly  as recently as  to  last year  the first time it has dropped below  since  gms equity income from the operations have also fallen down  since peaking in  according to regulatory filings

gms usbased brands such as buick and chevrolet have seen sales drop more than its joint venture sales with saic motor wuling motors and others the joint venture models accounted for about  of its  million vehicles sold last year in china

prior to this year the only quarterly losses for gm in china since  were a  million shortfall during the first quarter of  due to the coronavirus pandemic and an  million loss during the second quarter of 

the detroit automaker has reported three consecutive quarterly losses in equity income for its chinese operations this year totaling  million that includes a loss of  million during the third quarter

as we have consistently said we are focused on capital efficiency and cost discipline and have been working with sgm to turn around the business in china in order to be sustainable and profitable in the market we are close to finalizing our restructuring plan with our partner and we expect our results in china in  to show yearoveryear improvement gm said in an emailed statement

gm said it believes the joint venture has the ability to restructure without new cash investments from the american automaker

a majority of the restructuring costs is expected to be recognized as noncash special item charges during the fourth quarter that means they will impact the automakers net income but not its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes  a key metric monitored by wall street

gms operations in china have shifted from a profit engine to liability in the past decade as competition grows from governmentbacked domestic automakers fueled by nationalism and as a generational shift in consumer perceptions of the automotive industry and electric vehicles takes hold

equity income from gms chinese operations and joint ventures peaked at more than  billion in  and 

gms market share in china including its joint ventures has plummeted from roughly  as recently as  to  last year  the first time it has dropped below  since  gms equity income from the operations have also fallen down  since peaking in  according to regulatory filings

gms usbased brands such as buick and chevrolet have seen sales drop more than its joint venture sales with saic motor wuling motors and others the joint venture models accounted for about  of its  million vehicles sold last year in china

gm to sell stake in battery cell plant to joint venture partner for roughly  billion,33,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h560u4/gm_to_sell_stake_in_battery_cell_plant_to_joint/,1733174149.0,"general motors plans to sell its stake in a  billion electric vehicle battery cell plant in michigan to its joint venture partner lg energy solution the automaker announced monday

the detroit carmaker said it expects to recoup its investment in the facility which a source familiar with the plans said is anticipated to be roughly  billion the sale is part of a nonbinding agreement between the two companies thats anticipated to close during the first quarter of next year gm said

the nearly completed  millionsquarefoot plant in lansing michigan was expected to be the third battery cell facility of the joint venture known as ultium cells llc following plants in ohio and tennessee that have already opened and are operational

the lansing plant was announced in january  and the two companies first announced their joint venture five years ago

gms move comes as the automaker attempts to rightsize production of electric vehicles and confronts slowerthanexpected consumer demand it also comes amid uncertainty regarding federal incentives for manufacturing and purchasing evs in the us under presidentelect donald trump

the automaker said the sale does not impact its overall ownership stake in the joint venture or its future plans for a separate joint venture plant with lges rival samsung sdi

we believe we have the right cell and manufacturing capabilities in place to grow with the ev market in a capital efficient manner gm cfo paul jacobson said in a release when completed this transaction will also help lg energy solution meet demand by leveraging capacity thats nearly ready to come online and it will make gm even more efficient 

gm said the south korean battery supplier will have immediate access to the lansing facility to begin installation of equipment the plant which currently employs nearly  people was expected to begin operating by the end of this year

separate from the sale of its stake in the lansing facility gm on monday announced it will extend a year battery technology partnership with lges to include the development of an emerging type of battery cell called prismatic cells

prismatic cells are a flat rectangular shape with a rigid enclosure which allows for spaceefficient packaging within battery modules and packs gm said the cells are expected to reduce ev weights and costs while simplifying manufacturing by reducing the number of modules and mechanical components

were focused on optimizing our battery technology by developing the right battery chemistries and form factors to improve ev performance enhance safety and reduce costs by extending our partnership with lg energy solution were taking an important step towards these goals kurt kelty gm vice president of battery cell and pack said in a release

gm had previously said it planned to expand its battery cell technologies from its flat ultium pouches to include other forms such as prismatic cells

another biopharma stock trying to solve the issues of cancer an industry that is a holy grail for all pump and dumpers out here 

but is this one different to be honest i do not know but that is why i am posting this to hear other sides other points of view 

iova is currently sitting around  these are levels of before the this year run to  what goes up must come down when pumped and dumped however this company reported revenues mil revenue to be precise granted not enough to support current market cap but bear in mind it is bio industry we talk about it takes  approval and it is too late

leadership
ceo is there since  seems like an experienced guy was contributor to many oncology drugs already developed and approved

others seem legit as well this post is already too long feel free to research yourself

they also own a bit less than  so there is certain commitment there  and of course the vanguard black rock etc are heavily involved as well more than  is owned by institutions 

amtagvi product got approved by fda and that is now generating certain revenue they plan tk get approval in canada europe and uk as well 

they also work on ln iov and iov but lets be honest these are long shots and nothing guarantee success of these

i know these are speculations and putting some numbers from the future is no way to go but i feel like i have to just to make this post a bit more complete

potential yearly revenue if approved broader and if nothing goes wrong  is billion amount of people with cancer of specific type  cost of treatment but realistic values at beginning is bill per year or even less 

and then for all the gamblers time that with moon if other drugs get approved as well 

company with mil revenue and  million of debt with  billion market cap and  million of operating expenses company with future on the moon or in the sand do you hate iova or you will become a bag holder

they also own a bit less than  so there is certain commitment there  and of course the vanguard black rock etc are heavily involved as well more than  is owned by institutions 

amtagvi product got approved by fda and that is now generating certain revenue they plan tk get approval in canada europe and uk as well 

they also work on ln iov and iov but lets be honest these are long shots and nothing guarantee success of these

i know these are speculations and putting some numbers from the future is no way to go but i feel like i have to just to make this post a bit more complete

potential yearly revenue if approved broader and if nothing goes wrong  is billion amount of people with cancer of specific type  cost of treatment but realistic values at beginning is bill per year or even less 

and then for all the gamblers time that with moon if other drugs get approved as well 

company with mil revenue and  million of debt with  billion market cap and  million of operating expenses company with future on the moon or in the sand do you hate iova or you will become a bag holder

super micro computer pops  after special committee finds no evidence of misconduct,222,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4xtvz/super_micro_computer_pops_15_after_special/,1733154122.0,"super micro computer surged more than  after a special committee ruled that it found no evidence of misconduct at the embattled ai server maker and appointed a new chief accounting officer

anyone else buying the nu dip,26,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4wyxh/anyone_else_buying_the_nu_dip/,1733151877.0,"ive been an investor in nu for a while now i firmly believe the market is panic selling because warren buffet sold  of his stake in the company

today the company is down again because citi bank downgraded its rating on nu to a sell

why do people care that citi bank downgraded to a sell its literally a bank that could potentially have to rival nu soon if they break into usa markets citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing amazing company

if anything the downgrade should be seen as a good sign it shows that american banks like citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast nu has been able to expand its user base

i know brazil has made changes to its financial regulations however nu is rapidly expanding its user base to other countries plus brazils projected annual gdp growth per year is very good

do you guys agree


edit

thanks for all your thoughts ive realized there are a few key things i overlooked

i previously thought the stock was heavily owned by retail investors similar to sofis stock i naively assumed this because the stock is frequently discussed on social media due to this preconceived notion i believed the stock price would be significantly influenced by analyst ratings i still think a large number of people have started to sell because of warren buffett reducing his stake and citis sell recommendation however i now see that the primary factors driving this downturn are geopolitical and economic risks in brazil

my updated assessment is that the stock is being sold for a few very valid reasons firstly brazils inflation has been rising over the past few quarters secondly donald trump has threatened brics nations with  tariffs if they decide to create a currency to rival the us dollar thirdly warren buffett sold  of his stake in the company fourthly the value of brazils currency has been declining and recently hit historic lows compared to the us dollar finally brazils government spending was recently cut potentially signaling a slowdown in their economy

overall people are very concerned about the economic and geopolitical risks surrounding nu especially since it is a brazilian company brazil has a historically unstable economy and is currently facing economic headwinds that are amplified by the risk of potential tariffs

im taking a cautious approach from here on out i wont be selling any shares but i also wont be buying more until the stock price consolidates and the brazilian economy stabilizes

im still very bullish on nu because the company has grown unbelievably fast in just  years they survived brazils economic collapse in  and they also weathered the last round of us tariffs on brazil in  i believe nu will continue to expand rapidly into other latin american countries which will reduce its exposure to brazilian tariffs and economic challenges the ceo and management team are extremely competent and i believe in their ability to navigate these challenges in the long term

the worstcase scenario would be if the brics nations successfully create a new currency even then i still believe nu will be okay due to its expansion into other markets for now im holding and remain very bullish on the business","['anyon', 'el', 'buy', 'nu', 'dip']","['ive', 'investor', 'nu', 'firmli', 'believ', 'market', 'panic', 'sell', 'warren', 'buffet', 'sold', 'stake', 'compani', 'today', 'compani', 'citi', 'bank', 'downgrad', 'rate', 'nu', 'sell', 'peopl', 'care', 'citi', 'bank', 'downgrad', 'sell', 'liter', 'bank', 'could', 'potenti', 'rival', 'nu', 'soon', 'break', 'usa', 'market', 'citi', 'bank', 'worri', 'rapidli', 'grow', 'amaz', 'compani', 'anyth', 'downgrad', 'seen', 'good', 'sign', 'show', 'american', 'bank', 'like', 'citi', 'start', 'feel', 'bit', 'pressur', 'fast', 'nu', 'abl', 'expand', 'user', 'base', 'know', 'brazil', 'made', 'chang', 'financ', 'regul', 'howev', 'nu', 'rapidli', 'expand', 'user', 'base', 'countri', 'plu', 'brazil', 'project', 'annual', 'gdp', 'growth', 'per', 'year', 'good', 'guy', 'agr', 'edit', 'thank', 'thought', 'ive', 'realiz', 'key', 'thing', 'overlook', 'previou', 'thought', 'stock', 'heavili', 'own', 'retail', 'investor', 'similar', 'sofi', 'stock', 'naiv', 'assum', 'stock', 'frequent', 'discu', 'social', 'medium', 'due', 'preconceiv', 'notion', 'believ', 'stock', 'price', 'would', 'significantli', 'influenc', 'analyst', 'rate', 'still', 'think', 'larg', 'number', 'peopl', 'start', 'sell', 'warren', 'buffett', 'reduc', 'stake', 'citi', 'sell', 'recommend', 'howev', 'see', 'primari', 'factor', 'drive', 'downturn', 'geopolit', 'econom', 'risk', 'brazil', 'updat', 'as', 'stock', 'sold', 'valid', 'reason', 'firstli', 'brazil', 'inflat', 'rise', 'past', 'quarter', 'secondli', 'donald', 'trump', 'threaten', 'bric', 'nation', 'tariff', 'decid', 'creat', 'currenc', 'rival', 'u', 'dollar', 'thirdli', 'warren', 'buffett', 'sold', 'stake', 'compani', 'fourthli', 'valu', 'brazil', 'currenc', 'declin', 'recent', 'hit', 'histor', 'low', 'compar', 'u', 'dollar', 'final', 'brazil', 'govern', 'spend', 'recent', 'cut', 'potenti', 'signal', 'slowdown', 'economi', 'over', 'peopl', 'concern', 'econom', 'geopolit', 'risk', 'surround', 'nu', 'especi', 'sinc', 'brazilian', 'compani', 'brazil', 'histor', 'unstabl', 'economi', 'current', 'face', 'econom', 'headwind', 'amplifi', 'risk', 'potenti', 'tariff', 'im', 'take', 'cautiou', 'approach', 'wont', 'sell', 'share', 'also', 'wont', 'buy', 'stock', 'price', 'consolid', 'brazilian', 'economi', 'stabil', 'im', 'still', 'bullish', 'nu', 'compani', 'grown', 'unbeliev', 'fast', 'year', 'surviv', 'brazil', 'econom', 'collap', 'also', 'weather', 'last', 'round', 'u', 'tariff', 'brazil', 'believ', 'nu', 'continu', 'expand', 'rapidli', 'latin', 'american', 'countri', 'reduc', 'exposur', 'brazilian', 'tariff', 'econom', 'challeng', 'ceo', 'manag', 'team', 'extrem', 'compet', 'believ', 'abil', 'navig', 'challeng', 'long', 'term', 'worstca', 'scenario', 'would', 'bric', 'nation', 'success', 'creat', 'new', 'currenc', 'even', 'still', 'believ', 'nu', 'okay', 'due', 'expan', 'market', 'im', 'hold', 'remain', 'bullish', 'busi']","anyone else buying the nu dip ive been an investor in nu for a while now i firmly believe the market is panic selling because warren buffet sold  of his stake in the company

 hi i am an exprop shop equity trader

this is a daily watchlist for trading i might trade allnone of the stocks listed and even stocks not listed i only hold someall mag  stocks and market indices longterm if you use old reddit click show images at the top to expand the charts any positions stated arent recommendations im following subreddit rules to disclose positions i use ibkr tws for my platform and charts

i am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade i have no opinion on them as investments this means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting not the business longterm prospects or the people involved

please ask specific questions and please dont ask about earnings because i typically dont take positions before earnings announcements questions like thoughts on  or why isnt  on the watchlist or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion  if you post a question and delete it after i answer it i will block you doing that hurts discussion i am not answering questions if im still long or short a stock beyond what i update

interestingly enough a lot of executive replacements today

difference between splitting large companies by ftcdoj  and collaborating companies,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h3yi4i/difference_between_splitting_large_companies_by/,1733040171.0,"not sure is this is just obvious and a stupid question but my confusion arises from the recent demand to split google example selling chrome or android i understand this antitrust cases keep happening like i think it happened to microsoft some years ago but cant google sell its parts to a friend and still have continued access to whatever is needed

the evolution of an investor  which level are you,0,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h38kyf/the_evolution_of_an_investor_which_level_are_you/,1732956888.0,"i believe theres a common journey or evaluation of an investor we all start by knowing absolutely nothing about analyzing companies or investing in general but we get better over time as we accumulate knowledge and experience

level  the noob

at this level the focus is solely on the share price and its past performance so when the share price goes down from  to  the noob investor would conclude that now the stock is cheap and buying is the right thing to do of course this doesnt have to be the case in fact public companies that went bankrupt went on exactly this trajectory there are plenty of reasons why the share price could collapse and this decline could be justified however the noob investor isnt aware that there are many questions that one should ask

in addition at this level theres a tendency to follow the crowd and the opinion of others which is often times a really bad idea however without any knowledge and experience the opinions of others oftentimes sound logical and smart

level  the enthusiast

the enthusiast has heard that theres more to investing than just the share price youve started exploring financial statements and youre learning the basics of accounting for the first time the income statement balance sheet and cash flow statement start making sense im sure everyone can recall that time when you could read the financial statements and understand what they meant it comes with a confidence boost and it is normal to think ah ive got this investing thing figured out its easy

the catch is  even though it feels like a superpower this is still the beginning financial statements provide information about what happened not what will happen understanding them is useful but not enough to be a great investor

but at least now you can actually challenge some of the opinions of others

level  the seeker

this is where one is moving beyond the basics now youve learned that there are various valuation techniques that allow you to figure out what a company is worth it gets exciting this is where you get introduced to the ebitda and pe multiples relative valuation dividend discount model and dcf all of these can be powerful tools and theyre one piece of the puzzle to understand if a company is undervalued or not at some point you will likely stick with one or two models that work best for you

but heres the problem having the tools isnt the same as knowing how to use them at this stage it is common to have fancy spreadsheets with inputs that arent supported in any meaningful way other than historical financial data basically garbage in  garbage out you might not be aware of the disadvantages that come with the various models and fall into some of the common traps

however it doesnt feel that way when you spend hours gathering data and filling in your inputs it feels like a new superpower because in the end there is an output you have estimated the value of a company and now you can compare that with the market price

but if your assumptions about growth rates the discount rate or margins are significantly off your valuation is meaningless in fact theres a chance it harms you more than it helps you

by the way everything that ive mentioned until now can be  automated so up until this level you have no advantage over a relatively simple algorithm

level  the thinker

at this point you understand how important the inputs are

therefore the focus shifts a bit more towards understanding the industry and the broader environment and asking the right questions so that the input is more solid

for example if you are analyzing a car company you might want to understand if theres a trend regarding evs if there are any regulatory changes that will impact your margins if the company needs to invest more to expand its capacity etc

this is when research becomes your best friend youre no longer just looking at the company in isolationyoure connecting the dots between the company its competitors and the broader environment storytelling also becomes a part of your process as now youre not just crunching numbersyoure building a narrative about the companys future

level  the pro

this is the pinnacle of investing and where intangibles come into play

i dont mean goodwill and patents i mean the management team and the companys culture the key questions here are

 is the management trustworthy
 what is its track record
 what is its vision
 is there a culture that can survive tough times

culture is an oftenoverlooked factor in investing but its incredibly important as the saying goes culture eats strategy for breakfast a company with a strong culture can attract and retain top talent which is a must for being a great company

what i find interesting is that if you are to invest in a private company youd get to level  sooner than if you invest in public companies

heres an example imagine someone walks up to you and offers you to invest k in his company and in exchange youll have  of it the first question that youll have is who is this person if the person in question was someone you know for bad behavior misleading friends and family and many failed ventures you probably have your answer already and the idea is irrelevant

however if it was someone you knew who has integrity and many successful ventures then youd probably continue the conversation by asking questions about the idea itself your goal would be to understand the business whether it can survive in the environment and what return can you expect from it

however if it was someone you knew who has integrity and many successful ventures then youd probably continue the conversation by asking questions about the idea itself your goal would be to understand the business whether it can survive in the environment and what return can you expect from it

i hope you enjoyed this post and wish you great success on your investing journey do you recognize these levels in your own progression

fellow canadians whats the difference between zsp and vfv,10,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h2wlob/fellow_canadians_whats_the_difference_between_zsp/,1732916427.0,"ive been looking into canadian etfs and came across zsp bmo sp  index etf and vfv vanguard sp  index etf both track the sp  which is appealing to me because i want exposure to the us market but im trying to understand the differences between these two funds in more depth

on the surface they look very similar both are canadiandomiciled etfs that hold us equities and are traded on the tsx they both offer exposure to the same underlying index so their holdings should be nearly identical however i noticed a few potential areas where they might differ

mer management expense ratio zsp and vfv have slightly different mers does the lower mer really make a noticeable difference over the long term or is it more of a nice to have

tracking error are there any known differences in how closely these funds track the sp  are there any instances where one deviated more significantly than the other

liquidity and trading spreads for someone who might not be buying or selling huge quantities are there noticeable differences in the bidask spreads do they trade with similar liquidity or does one tend to have an advantage

currency hedging from what i understand neither of these funds is hedged to cad is there any other nuance to their handling of currency that i should be aware of

dividend treatment both distribute dividends but does one reinvest them differently or handle us withholding tax in a way that might make it more or less taxefficient

historical performance have you noticed any meaningful differences in performance between these two over the years even if minor what could explain the difference if the index they track is identical

lastly id love to hear what you personally use and why are there specific scenarios where zsp might be better than vfv or vice versa is it purely a matter of brand loyalty vanguard vs bmo or are there more practical considerations

im also curious about how either fits into a broader portfolio if youre holding one of these are you pairing it with other us exposure like qqq or do you lean heavily on canadian equities like vcn for balance

why i think uber is a buy,0,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h2kshj/why_i_think_uber_is_a_buy/,1732883538.0,"personal trading context

i do not look at balance sheets ever i invest in companies that are undervalued due to bad publicity and not bad product this year when crowdstrike dipped from  to  i immediately took a position because i knew it was because of panic and not because the companys products are losing inherent value i did the same for meta during the whole vr panic and tesla earlier this year all of which dipped and are now up by more than  stock prices are determined by emotional sentiment so analyzing balance sheets are a waste of time to me

about uber

i dont know anything about ubers debts or profits but i do know they are deviously good at getting around regulations and have completely pitted customers and drivers against each other recently i saw a post saying how uber is sorry that they will now only allow drivers hired by agencies to drive instead of individual contractors in some european region do you think uber is really sorry this sounds like the government is getting involved and constricting uber but im going to tell you why these things dont even matter

recently in my area the government passed regulations making uber pay a minimum of hr youd assume this will cut into ubers profits but they got around it and drivers are not actually getting any of that money whats crazy is that theyre now pocketing more money from customers due to this change i went into detail in another post which is important for you to read to help fully comprehend my view httpswwwredditcomrubereatscommentsgzpvrdnewuberminimumpayisnotwhatyouthinkhttpswwwredditcomrubereatscommentsgzpvrdnewuberminimumpayisnotwhatyouthink

after going through that link you should understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but theyre actually earning less and customers are paying more this is where im dumbfounded because even though i pointed out that uber is deceiving its customers and charging them a bogus service fee instead of getting mad at uber theyre getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more i thought i was doing a good thing by informing people how the new service fee theyre paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by uber but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money ive been getting posts in my feed from rtipping recently and theyre pretty much all complaints against restaurants drivers and overall tipping culture i also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on rubereatsdrivers customers dont want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works they hate drivers drivers make less money and hate customers as a result both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually uber themselves this is amazing for investors

i love how uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money if you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them if you like ai this makes uber a great alternative to buying straight nvda or tsla they dont give a shit about you or me only revenue but theyre damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers i fucking love it if youre going to spend money on uber spend it on shares

i love how uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money if you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them if you like ai this makes uber a great alternative to buying straight nvda or tsla they dont give a shit about you or me only revenue but theyre damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers i fucking love it if youre going to spend money on uber spend it on shares

again i dont read balance sheets ever please do inform me on why it matters and why uber is not a good buy",633,0.9911,positive

most fundamentals are updated every  months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports

expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well

but growth stocks dont rely so much on eps or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count  going from  million to  million subscribers means more revenue in the future

value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both eps  revenue  youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never invest in a company solely for its dividend

i think bird flu risk is being underestimated by the market long on mrna,220,156,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1yuwt/i_think_bird_flu_risk_is_being_underestimated_by/,1732809014.0,"so far hn has been slowly making its way from chickens to cows around the middle of  and now pigs in oregon within the last couple weeks there have been a few mild human cases basically all in farm workers working closely with infected animals although there was at least one case recently where they had no idea where the patient got infected from

normally cdc will be tracking all this and keeping tabs on isolation of infected communitiesindividuals this flu seems to be most prevalent in the us than other countries so far and we have much more transparency and observability than china so my risk assessment for this has been pretty low until trump got elected

but trump has been making it very very clear that hes going to pull every stop to deport undocumented migrants most of the people working in shitty conditions in farms areundocumented undocumented workers are normally able to access some level of public services like healthcare but this is about to get completely shut down by the trump admin and these farm workers are about to get shoved into concentrated compartments with really poor hygiene conditions and its going to take a long time for them to actually get processed and deported many will run and hide and that will also end up hiding how many people are actually infected and spreading the disease

moderna was given  million in july by the hhs to develop an mrna bird flu vaccine there already exists a bird flu vaccine made by csl seqirus but i would imagine that the trump administration will want to call upon a wellknown american company to manufacture america first vaccines

mrna has been down for many months as the covid hype worn down but they recently announcedhttpswwwbiospacecombusinessmodernaslashesrdbudgetbybeyesapprovalsthrough that they are reducing rd expenses and focusing on  approvals by  theyve also been making huge jumps in the last week due to a bullish sales viewhttpswwwinvestopediacommodernastockjumpsfollowingbullishsalesviewathealthcareconference im long on mrna",382,-0.9829,negative

microsoft faces wideranging us antitrust probe,189,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1kqio/microsoft_faces_wideranging_us_antitrust_probe/,1732757894.0,"the us federal trade commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into microsoft including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses a source familiar with the matter said on wednesday

the probe was approved by ftc chair lina khan ahead of her likely departure in january the election of donald trump as us president and the expectation he will appoint a fellow republican with a softer approach toward business leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air  
  
the ftc is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its azure cloud service to other competitive platforms sources confirmed earlier this month  
  
the ftc is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products the source said on wednesday

microsoft declined to comment on wednesday  
  
the ftc fielded complaints about microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market

netchoice a lobbying group that represents online companies including amazon and google which compete with microsoft in cloud computing criticized microsofts licensing policies and its integration of ai tools into its office and outlook

given that microsoft is the worlds largest software company dominating in productivity and operating systems software the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary the group said  
the ftc has demanded a broad range of detailed information from microsoft bloomberg reported earlier on wednesday  
  
until now microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to us antitrust regulators recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at big tech companies  
  
facebook owner meta platforms apple and amazoncom inc have all been accused by the us of unlawfully maintaining monopolies  
  
alphabets google is facing two lawsuits including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines  
  
microsoft ceo satya nadella testified at googles trial saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence  
  
it is unclear whether trump will ease up on big tech whose first administration launched several big tech probes jd vance the incoming vice president has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse

the probe was approved by ftc chair lina khan ahead of her likely departure in january the election of donald trump as us president and the expectation he will appoint a fellow republican with a softer approach toward business leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air  
  
the ftc is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its azure cloud service to other competitive platforms sources confirmed earlier this month  
  
the ftc is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products the source said on wednesday

microsoft declined to comment on wednesday  
  
the ftc fielded complaints about microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market

netchoice a lobbying group that represents online companies including amazon and google which compete with microsoft in cloud computing criticized microsofts licensing policies and its integration of ai tools into its office and outlook

given that microsoft is the worlds largest software company dominating in productivity and operating systems software the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary the group said  
the ftc has demanded a broad range of detailed information from microsoft bloomberg reported earlier on wednesday  
  
until now microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to us antitrust regulators recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at big tech companies  
  
facebook owner meta platforms apple and amazoncom inc have all been accused by the us of unlawfully maintaining monopolies  
  
alphabets google is facing two lawsuits including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines  
  
microsoft ceo satya nadella testified at googles trial saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence  
  
it is unclear whether trump will ease up on big tech whose first administration launched several big tech probes jd vance the incoming vice president has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse

looking for advice combining technical analysis with newsbased and highvolatility trading,9,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h11987/looking_for_advice_combining_technical_analysis/,1732703017.0,"hi everyone
ive been trading more actively lately focusing on highvolatility stocks and newsbased opportunities this year has been very successful for me ive managed to achieve returns that were even above the sp  so im really happy with my progress

that said im always looking to improve and im wondering if integrating technical analysis into my approach could help me refine my strategy further i usually hold my positions for a few days to a few weeks i have a few questions
	
	which technical indicators would you recommend for someone trading on a short to medium term basis and reacting to newsdriven moves
	
	are there specific timeframes or chart setups that work better for trades lasting days or weeks 
	
	are there any books courses or resources youd recommend for learning technical analysis especially for highvolatility setups
	
	how do you handle risk management when trading in such volatile environments

   how can i identify which stocks are likely to have the highest trading volume or volatility during the day 

i know theres no one size fits all solution but i believe combining fundamental insights with technical analysis could help me make better informed decisions


thanks in advance to anyone who shares their experience or advice

that said im always looking to improve and im wondering if integrating technical analysis into my approach could help me refine my strategy further i usually hold my positions for a few days to a few weeks i have a few questions
	
	which technical indicators would you recommend for someone trading on a short to medium term basis and reacting to newsdriven moves
	
	are there specific timeframes or chart setups that work better for trades lasting days or weeks 
	
	are there any books courses or resources youd recommend for learning technical analysis especially for highvolatility setups
	
	how do you handle risk management when trading in such volatile environments

   how can i identify which stocks are likely to have the highest trading volume or volatility during the day 

i know theres no one size fits all solution but i believe combining fundamental insights with technical analysis could help me make better informed decisions


thanks in advance to anyone who shares their experience or advice

deep dive into kering  from timber to gucci a legacy of acquisitions,25,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h117vj/deep_dive_into_kering_from_timber_to_gucci_a/,1732702849.0," introduction

lets start with a fun fact kering the company that owns brands like gucci yves saint laurent balenciaga bottega veneta and alexander mcqueen started as a timbertrading company

although it started back in  and operated in a different industry its dna and management style havent changed much

as im writing this its share price is down over  from its peak back in august  that was elevated due to the covid pandemic

  
 the journey from timber to luxury

 the timber period   

the company was founded in france by franois pinault back in  with a  francs loan from the bank the business grew rapidly by acquiring many failing local timber traders in france especially in the s by  it owned  companies and  factories

 the switch from timber to retail to luxury     present

in  it was listed on the paris stock exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started

 it merged with cfao a french distribution conglomerate
 acquired conforama french furniture retailer
 acquired printemps department stores
 acquired  of la redoute french mailorder shopping retailer
 acquired finac french bookstore multimedia and electronics retailer

the transformation from retail to luxury started in  when it acquired  of gucci group  of boucheron and  of yves saint laurent today gucci accounts for  of its revenue

franoishenri pinault the son of the founder franois pinault became general manager of the company in  and ceo in  under his leadership the acquisitions in the luxury space continued

it is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions conforama le printemps cfao and fnac

its portfolio is quite diversified and includes

 highend clothing
 footwear
 handbags and leather goods
 sunglasses and eyewear
 scarves  other fashion accessories
 jewelry
 fragrances due to the creed acquisition
 cosmetics in early stage
 watches

it is also geographically diversified

 apac excl japan  of revenue
 western europe  of revenue
 north america  of revenue
 japan  of revenue
 rest of the world  of revenue

 historical financial performance

its revenue increased from  billion in  to  billion in  and has contracted back to  billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic 

kerings gross margin is stable at  meaning the direct costs are well controlled

however its operating margin is down below  vs  back in  the explanation is simple

reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job

when theres less traffic and subsequently less sales in the physical stores the operating expenses remain the same the company still needs to pay the lease payment its employees the utility bills etc in fact these expenses grow over time as theres the impact of inflation

scaling down by closing locations is also not a free option not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location

the company is generating substantial cash flows but ill argue the capital allocation is poor

all numbers in m

cash january 
operating cash flow
capex
acquisitions
debt
share buyback
dividends
other
cash june 

between  and h the company generated over  billion in operating cash flow or a bit less than  billion after capex

close to  of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends and an additional  through share buybacks whats left of the free cash flow together with additional debt was used for acquisitions

why do i think the capital allocation is poor two main reasons

 almost  of the share buybacks were used in  and  the years when the share price was the highest and temporarily elevated a good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares
 its net debt position more than doubled from  billion in  to  billion as of june th  this is equal to  of its market cap the interest rate on their debt ranges from  to  and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate it could significantly reduce its profit margins



 what can be expected

based on the latest investor presentation there are three capital allocation priorities

 organic growth
 shareholder return and
 fuel highpotential adjacent businesses

all of it while having a healthy financial situation and fcf generation

this is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company i find this slide a bit odd for three reasons

 on one side they want to return capital to the shareholders which would position them as a company with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends on the other side its history is full of acquisitions which is the opposite of preserving capital
 the center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and fcf generation while its net debt more than doubled in the last  years  billion in  to  billion as of june th 
 innovation is not a focus at all roughly  months ago essilorluxottica and meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category i see a lot of potential in this area that isnt utilized yet

growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the dna of the company and likely what one should expect going forward

  
 dividends

the dividend per share has been steadily increasing from  back in  to  in  the current dividend yield is 

if the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends instead of borrowing to acquire more companies kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option

  
 high employee turnover

at the end of  the company had  employees during the year there were  new hires and  employees departed at first glance this is no doubt a high turnover

this sounds bad at first but it is really difficult to decipher

in theory any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees temporarily during peak seasons therefore the increase and subsequently decrease of employees is normal this is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive such as sales and manufacturing

in addition  of the employees are gen y  a generation that is known for seeking career growth which could lead to more jobhopping than average

given the reviews on indeed glassdoor and comparably there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue

  
 the concerns

 balenciaga advertising scandal 

back in  balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign one of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondageinspired outfits this was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate

this brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing

in addition given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top  brands gucci   ysl   bottega veneta   scandals of this kind could have a significant impact

 preliminary investigation by the european commission 

in april  the european commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector one of the inspections took place at the italian premises of gucci

an investigation of this kind does not imply guilt but if a company is found in breach of eu antitrust rules there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros

the investigation is still ongoing and no conclusions have been reached

  
 valuation 

this is a mature market that will be around for a very long time therefore here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing kering

 revenue  the industry is cyclical in nature so there will be good and bad times based on the past i do not feel confident that kering can take market share so i expect its growth to normalize at  per year which is in line with the inflation rate
 operating margin  the luxury market is getting more crowded and as argued earlier reducing operating expenses is not an easy task once the demand is somewhat stable i expect the operating margin to increase to 

based on those assumptions and a discount rate of  the fair value of the company is  billion share which is very close to the current price of share

this offers an irr of  which is slightly below the historical return of the sp

  
 the bull case

those who are betting on kering are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following

 revitalization of balenciaga  rebuilding its reputation after the controversies
 sustained growth in gucci and expansion of secondary brands like bottega veneta  saint laurent
 the success of its newly launched beauty division capturing market share from rivals like lvmh and estee lauder
 positive macro tailwinds

 utilizing pricing power
 integration of recent acquisitions
 reducing operating costs

if the management can pull this off then the value per share could be x from todays share price



 the bear case

those who are betting against kering are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following

 brand mismanagement  more scandals
 inability to revitalize balenciaga
 inability to innovate around its primary brands
 failure to integrate its acquisitions  further poor ma acquisitions
 negative macro tailwinds
 inability to innovate around ecommerce
 supply chain issues
 competitive pressure
 increase in corporate tax by the french authorities

in this scenario the fair value per share could be below share

opinions on zeta,17,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h0mqz8/opinions_on_zeta/,1732655004.0,"
i have watched this stock for some time and it is super interesting

 culper research shorts zeta and publishes findings on some misconducts from zeta

 shares drop big time

 zeta responds to all claims from culper and
proves them as lies one of examples is that culper mentiones ey as zetas auditor but ey was never zetas auditor it was always deloitte

 zeta insiders buy large amount of shares as another sign to support the company and that culper research is lying and playing dirty

 shares bounce back a bit

 former louisiana attorney general leads class action suit against zeta another dirty move to stop a bounce back or honestly concerned ex politician

 shares drop this week again

isnt it crazy how few people can destroy a company for personal interest using deception and dirty tricks or is the company the one that is corrupt

in my opinion culper clearly lied on many things as a strategy for their short positions history showed that companies that were shorted by culper did just fine in the future is this case the same

what is your opinion on this is it good entry point is it too risky to enter

btw fundamentals of this company are good
healthy growth nice debt ratio and management strong institutional ownership etc

ganja bear case and one possible exception,0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gzfcoy/ganja_bear_case_and_one_possible_exception/,1732528321.0,"i think cannabis is an abysmally bad investment opportunity with one exception and almost no one knows why because the precise nature of how thc as a drug operates isnt well understood by people who arent both habitual consumers and uptodate with knowledge on that sector this past decade or so

its the following issue lets say its  when cannabis is still illegal everywhere and i want to get high i light up a single  joint with my friend we smoke for  minutes and then were giggling we go to buy some twice a month or so a few years later its been legalized and a ton of money floods into the space growers are all trying to compete with each other to take advantage of the laws changing everyone wants to make stronger weed that gets you high more quickly than the other kinds to draw customers to them get market share and so on buy my iridescent purple galactic stardust reefer that gets you as high in one puff as x that amount of the neighboring places stuff

this is a race to the bottom soon everyone is selling incredibly strong stuff but you need far less of it to get the same high habitual users spend less than  of what they used to on weed now everything is absurdly strong and cheap because of this competition in addition you now have hash oil edibles dab pens tinctures you name it not just regular flower

i never smoked much anyway but in the rare case i want a minivacation now i can take a vial of tincture and put one drop under my tongue within two hours the world is spinning its so strong i never use it as anything other than a sleeping aid about once a month a single bottle of this costs about  and it comfortably lasts me an entire year this is a disaster for the industry because i almost never need to give them business its so strong that i rarely need to make a purchase at all and no need for all the paraphernalia with it either no vapes pipes lighters etc the bottle comes with an eyedropper even if i use it often and develop a high tolerance i still rarely need to go out for more my friend and i have no reason to go smoke or spend much money on the supplies for it when for th the price we can get the same high now assuming one of us has a tincture or dab vape pen or edible or a newly exotic and potent strain at home

compare this with alcohol where you cant make say vodka much stronger than it is its impossible for me to come up with a x stronger vodka to put my competitors out of business because its physically impossible for alcohol to exist at room temperature at concentrations higher than  i think and vodka is already around  and cant reasonably go much higher taste etc also there is a social nature to it that weed lacks beer works more as a refreshment beverage like coke etc

or cigarettes where even if you have a huge nicotine tolerance from constant zyn use the nature of the substance requires you to take it every couple hours to keep from getting jittery you cant just get a years supply of nicotine in a bottle because first of all itd be fatal with a slight dosage error you need to have it in measured amounts you can take every  hours regardless of how much youre used to consuming assuming youre dependent on it to begin with of course and so it is a consistent business for sellers this is most true of cigarettes but also applies to vapes and pouches which have similarly excellent profit margins all of these a nicotine addict must consume regularly regulations also limit how much nicotine you can put in each product

it is a subscription model in short while weed is equivalent to motor oil in terms of how often someone a very heavy user to boot has to go out and buy some and how much they spend alcohol has some issues as well of lesser magnitude that i can go into elsewhere but can lean on its usefulness in social situations whereas weed cannot

the only exception to this turning point brands tpb stock because they dont sell weed they sell rolling papers and other paraphernalia for it which is indeed still a growing business if it gets legalized in more places and benefits from the greater proliferation of the stuff actual weed sellers do not because the increased proliferation is offset by people needing to buy less of it for the same results due to increased thc concentration in the products you cant sell th as much paper to people for the same effect or at least its less affected by this issue the company also is wisely getting into nicotine pouches although this is very ambitious of them to compete with the tobacco majors directly on something not sure how thatll work out keep in mind this is a small cap company less than  billion in market cap reflecting how little profit there is to be made even on the periphery of this sector but its one small and thriving business i can find that has benefited from all this quite nicely not sure how much more it can grow its probably overvalued now but in the past year or so its risen strongly

evaluation of companies with down revenue,36,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gyd256/evaluation_of_companies_with_down_revenue/,1732404715.0,"i find this an interesting topic and am interested how others feel if a company would be considered potentially bullish with the following fundamentals

 cash flow per share growth year over year
 net profit margin growth year over year
 lower longterm debt year over year

but also has

 lower revenue year over year
 lower net income year over year
 lower earnings per share year over year

in my opinion when revenue or net income is declining and not flat or increasing it is a concern that the company could be on the brink of a big downturn especially in a continued pattern of these results

however i often see companies with these symptoms sometimes in different combinations but at least two of these are lower year over year however the chart is very bullish at times
