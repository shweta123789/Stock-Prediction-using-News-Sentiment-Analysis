# Stock Prediction using News Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict stock price movements based on sentiment analysis of stock-related news articles. By scraping news articles, analyzing their sentiment, and training a machine learning model, we can predict whether a stock's price will go up or down. The model is then exposed via a Flask API, allowing real-time predictions to be made based on new data.

### Key Features:
- **Data Scraping**: Collects stock-related news articles using web scraping techniques.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the articles to categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Logistic Regression model to predict stock price movements based on sentiment scores and other features.
- **API Deployment**: Provides a Flask API that allows users to make real-time stock movement predictions.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The primary programming language for this project.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Used for scraping stock-related news from the web.
- **scikit-learn**: Used to train the machine learning model.
- **Flask**: Used to deploy the model as a web API.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading the trained model.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
